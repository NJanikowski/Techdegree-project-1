            <h2>From Codes to Coding</h2>
            <p>I grew up in the PNW and the South. at 18 I moved to Central New York and attended college there. I found that traditional schooling wasn't for me and wanted to follow a dream.</p>
            <p>I packed my bags and moved to Central Texas with some friends. There I followed my dream of becoming a Paramedic.</p>
            <p>Working in high volume rural 911 for 10 years. During that time I worked on several FEMA disaster deployments. As well as being in the field during the Pandemic.</p>
            <p>With my average work week being 72 hours. I wanted a change so that I could be home more with my fiancé. I made the choice to follow another passion I had which was coding. Plus the allure of sleeping in my bed everynight and being home with family.</p>
            <p>After hearing about Treehouse on several podcasts and many long talks with my fiancé.
                We decided that I should take the plunge and devot myself full time to this path. I "retired" from in field 911 and began my coding journey.
            </p>
            <p>In my freetime I enjoy camping,bouldering, and hiking. As long as the weather permits.
                If trapped indoors then its reading,gaming, and getting a game of Warhammer 40k in.
